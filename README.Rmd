## General info

Code used for creating long-billed hermit song cultural evolution trees and analyzing evolutionary patterns.

## Analysis

* [Optimizing cost for MAFFT alignments](https://rpubs.com/marcelo-araya-salas/601010)
* [Aligning song sequences with mafft and prank](https://rpubs.com/marcelo-araya-salas/601065)

## In progress

* Making trees with RevBayes ([diagnostics](https://rpubs.com/marcelo-araya-salas/622214)) 


## To-do list

* Run SUR longer (double) and higher thining and burning (double)
* Try fixed (global) molecular clock 

## Status
Project is: _in progress_
